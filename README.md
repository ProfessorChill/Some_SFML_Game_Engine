# Some SFML Game Engine

## Requirements
* SFML
* LUA
* tinyxml2
* boost (for boost filesystem)

I plan on making a static build when I find out how to.

## Building
```
$ cd build
$ make
```

## Using the engine
In its current state it doesn't support modifications nor custom LUA. This will be updated when support is added.
You can edit the one map in resources/maps/untitled.tmx there is no check for custom files yet.
